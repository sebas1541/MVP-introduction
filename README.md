This repository stores code for a programming task at college. It uses the model-view-presenter pattern to perform the actions it is supposed to do.
According to the teacher's guidelines, the code should output a system that calculates a daily wage for a company, considering the hours worked by each employee. Array lists must be used to collect hours and names of employees, so the number of employees can be calculated and stored in this list.
